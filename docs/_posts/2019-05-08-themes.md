excerpt: Change the user-interface to your liking
---

*(This change is in v0.9.0+)*

The lnav user-interface can now be customized by selecting one of the
builtin themes, like
[monocai](https://github.com/tstack/lnav/blob/master/src/themes/monocai.json)
and
[night-owl](https://github.com/tstack/lnav/blob/master/src/themes/night-owl.json),
or
[by defining your own theme](https://lnav.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#theme-definitions).

Selecting a theme can be done through the
[`:config`](https://docs.lnav.org/en/latest/commands.html#config-option-value)
command, like so:

```
:config /ui/theme monocai
```

Pressing `TAB` after the `/ui/theme ` will cycle through the available themes,
like so:
